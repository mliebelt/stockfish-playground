# Stockfish 16

This is the official port of stockfish with all current features. I will try to understand how it is integrated then in a web page, by trying out some examples.

It should work like that:

1. Do `npm install` to have all files locally.
2. Do `npm run copy-lib` to copy the relevant library files to the directory `lib`.
3. Start a web server by running `npm run serve`.
4. Go to URL `http://localhost:8080/index.html` and see if the example is running.
